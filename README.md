# LightGameFrameworkSDL2
Code taken from the tutorials posted on youtube by Light Game Frameworks. You see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRLIAdKMQK8&amp;list=PLUFd3gYWwiYFdSoqZp35RU6mja4N5u4dz&amp;index=1
In this repository, all the projects carried out in the tutorials have been grouped into Visual Studio C++ Community 2022 using the 64bit version. In the properties of each project (tutorial episode) you only need to change the path of the includes and libs of the SDL2 series, which I have stored everything in a fixed path.
